EXERCISE 

You are requested to implement a method to multiply integer numbers using the addition operator (+) and not the multiplication operator (x), storing the values in arrays.

So, for example, to calculate “15 × 2 ” you will store these values in two arrays to perform the operation:
[0, 0, 0, 1, 5]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 2]

The result will end in a third array as in:
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0]

Considering moreover that the addition operation is only possible between single digits [0,9] and the new multiplication function must be usable to calculate the factorial value of 100 (100 !, the product of the first 100 integers).

Note: 
* Write the requested code in a programming language of your choice
* It's not required, but adding unit tests will be taken into account
